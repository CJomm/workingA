                Social media platforms have become popular as major
                communication channels that effectively contribute to shaping
                the media landscape in our country nowadays. A vast majority of
                public figures and consumer products have long been utilizing
                these cost-effective channels to reach out to their audience in
                communicating their views and advertising materials. Beyond
                communicating these views and materials, social media platforms
                make public figures humanize themselves and that helps their
                audience feel more connected to them.

                Did you know that Filipinos are the world’s top social media
                users, spending more than 4 hours every day on these sites? The
                top social media channels include Facebook, Twitter, and
                Instagram.

                By allowing your audience to be in touch with you through these
                sites is already a big step towards your success. The same goes
                on your end—to understand your audience and know how to reach
                out to them whenever the trends change. With the advanced
                targeting capabilities this platform offers plus a well-thought
                digital strategy, imagine reaching a vast number of potential
                audiences with just a fraction of the cost compared to
                traditional marketing.

                Having a solid social strategy is vital, part of which is
                choosing the most appropriate social platforms for the nature of
                your business as well as the target audience. There should be a
                clear impetus behind the choice. Testing and analyzing the most
                relevant platforms, as well as types of content, are fundamental
                to the process.

              <h5 className="" style={{ textAlign: "justify", margin: "20px" }}>
                Getting on social media is paramount to kicking off the campaign
                in the right direction. Branding the accounts and pages is an
                important component of optimization. The use of social keywords
                to target the audience and content also contributes to achieving
                the goals of the campaign.

                Creating a social campaign from scratch is not without
                difficulties and what is more managing such. No two social
                campaigns are alike; not even for the same brand targeting two
                different platforms. The campaign, however, must be backed by
                research and analysis. Social listening is also crucial in the
                early stages of the campaign.
